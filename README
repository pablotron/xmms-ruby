Introduction
============
Xmms-Ruby is a Ruby interface to Xmms.  It allows you to adjust the
equalizer, playlist, and playing options for one or more XMMS sessions
within Ruby.  I haven't written a tutorial yet, but there is rdoc-
generated API documentation in doc/, and a couple of sample ruby Xmms
control scripts in examples/.  Feel free to email me if you have any
additional questions.

System Requirements
===================
- XMMS, version 1.2.6 (or newer):
  http://www.xmms.org/
- Ruby, version 1.6.x (or newer):
  http://www.ruby-lang.org/

Installation
============
ruby ./extconf.rb            # generate Makefile
make && su -c "make install" # compile and install library

FAQ
===
Q.  Why don't the balance controls work?
A.  You're probably running XMMS 1.2.6, which has a bug in
    xmms_remote_{get,set}_balance().  Specifically, they don't appear to
    work at all when XMMS is stopped.
